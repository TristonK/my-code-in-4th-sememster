Problem B: Binary Image Matching(poj3690转化为long long进行hash)
Time Limit: 1 Sec  Memory Limit: 128 MB

Description

The binary images are the matrix of 1 and 0. And 1 stands for white while 0 stands for black. Now here is a big binary image with height H and width W and T small binary images with height h and width w. How many small images appearing in the big image?
Input

The input is just one test case.
The test case starts with a line containing five integers H, W, T, h and w(1 <= H, W <= 1000, 1 <= T <= 100, 1 <= h, w <= 50). The following H lines describe the H × W big binary image, each of which contains W characters '1' or '0'. The last part of the test case describe T small binary images, each of which takes h lines in the same format as big binary image(every line with w characters). There is a blank line preceding each small binary image.
Output

Print the number of small images appearing in the big image with only one line.

HINT

You just need to make sure whether a small image appearing in the big image. You don't need to konw how many times does this small image appear in the big image.
